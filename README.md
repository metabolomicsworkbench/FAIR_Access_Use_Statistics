# FAIR_Access_Use_Statistics
Access and Use Statistics and FAIR metrics on Metabolomics Workbench (MW)

We used both custom analysis of apache logs and Visitors tool
(http://www.hping.org/visitors/) on combined access_log and ssl_access_log. vsftpd log was
analyzed separately. 

In the file [MW_FAIR_report_Feb13-Mar13_2022.pdf](https://github.com/metabolomicsworkbench/FAIR_Access_Use_Statistics/blob/main/MW_FAIR_report_Feb13-Mar13_2022.pdf), access and use statistics are based on analysis of the log over about one month (Feb 13 â€“ Mar 13, 2022), except for GitHub access logs, which are based on access over three months (Jan - March, 2022).
