# FAIR_Access_Use_Statistics
Access and Use Statistics and FAIR metrics on Metabolomics Workbench (MW)

We used both custom analysis of apache logs and Visitors tool
(http://www.hping.org/visitors/) on combined access_log and ssl_access_log. vsftpd log was
analyzed separately. Access and use statistics are based on analysis of the log over about one month.
(Feb 13 â€“ Mar 13, 2022).
